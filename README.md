# What is PureType?

PureType is a platform for daily developer learning across a number of languages and technologies with two layers:

* for **feedback**, editor assistants and code reviewers that help to avoid common mistakes at the function/module level by developers still learning about a new language or technology
* for **follow-up**, a web interface with a set of daily exercises to confirm and build understanding, building on the feedback patterns observed

The goal is to give developers the structure and guidance they need daily to grow quickly and gain experience.
