# What is PureType?

PureType is a platform for daily developer learning with two layers:

* for **feedback**, editor assistants and code reviewers that help to avoid common mistakes at the function/module level in various languages and technologies, to help write idiomatic code
* for **follow-up**, a web interface with a set of daily exercises to confirm and build understanding, building on the feedback patterns observed

The goal is to give developers the structure and guidance they need daily to grow quickly and gain experience.
