# What is PureType?

PureType is a platform for daily developer learning across [a number of languages and technologies](overview/supported-languages-and-technologies/), with two main layers:

* for **feedback**, [code reviewers](integrating-puretype/scm-integrations.md) and [IDE extensions](integrating-puretype/ide-extensions.md) that help to avoid common mistakes at the function/module level by developers still learning about a new language or technology
* for **follow-up**, [a web interface](the-knowledge-journey/overview.md) to review and build understanding through regular exercises and suggested activities, building on the feedback patterns observed

The goal is to give developers the structure and guidance they need to consistently grow and gain experience quickly.

With [the knowledge landscape](the-knowledge-journey/the-knowledge-landscape.md), engineer managers can oversee, review and understand their team's capaibilities in detail.
