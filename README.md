# What is PureType?

PureType is a platform for daily developer learning, comprised of two layers:

* for **feedback**, an IDE assistant/code reviewer that helps to avoid common mistakes at the function/module level in a number of different languages and technologies and helps write idiomatic code
* for **follow-up**, a web interface with a set of daily exercises to confirm and build understanding, building on the feedback patterns observed

The goal is to give developers the structure and guidance they need to grow quickly and gain experience.
