description: Scope and purpose of PureType's third-party integrations
---

# Overview

There are two types of **third-party integrations** that provide PureType with the context it requires to recommend personalised learning activities:

* [**SCM integrations**](scm-integrations/) to support automated review during the pull request process to augment human review
* [**IDE** ](ide-extensions/)[**extensions**](ide-extensions/) to provide developers with feedback as they code, and to occasionally prompt them to review their learning material.

The [nature of the feedback](feedback-principles.md) that PureType suggests is primarily intended for human consumption and requires judgement, so CI integrations are not a priority.

One or both of these types of extension should be installed. PureType cannot generate a personalised learning journey without access to a developer's activity.

To help support developers build learning habits, [**learning integrations**](learning-integrations.md) are also available.
