# Overview

There are two types of integrations that provide PureType with the context it requires to recommend personalised learning activities:

* [**SCM integrations**](scm-integrations/) to support automated review during the pull request process to augment human review
* [**IDE** ](ide-extensions/)[**extensions**](ide-extensions/) to provide developers with feedback as they code

One or both of these types of extension should be installed. PureType cannot generate a personalised learning journey without access to a developer's work.

To help support developers build learning habits, [**learning integrations**](learning-integrations.md) are also available.
