# IDE extensions

PureType provides an IDE plugin that boosts productivity by providing real-time, contextual feedback as developers code. It identifies potential issues with specific approaches, allowing developers to address them early in the software development lifecycle, enhancing code quality and reducing debugging time.

See [Supported languages and technologies](../../overview/supported-languages-and-technologies/) for particular areas of feedback that PureType may provide for a given language or technology.

## Visual Studio Code

See [**Visual Studio Code**](visual-studio-code.md).

## Other IDEs
