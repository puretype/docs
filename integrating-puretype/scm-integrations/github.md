# GitHub

Once [the PureType GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/puretype) is installed, teams can configure review behaviors specific to their workflow, enabling automated suggestions and tracking improvements.

This integration ensures that developers consistently write idiomatic code and always receive feedback and follow-up to grow with each pull request.
