# Learning integrations

Building repeatable learning habits involves presenting cues to developers at suitable moments. Learning integrations aim to help achieve that, without being unduly annoying to a developer or by breaking their state of flow.

## Slack

Slack is a useful medium for reminders and interactivity for learning.
