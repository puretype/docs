PureType's reviewer bot serves as a new software development lifecycle stage, intelligently identifying potential issues within your repository and providing constructive feedback. When it encounters code that could benefit from improvement or educational insight, PureType leaves comments that guide users towards relevant educational resources

This feature not only helps in maintaining higher code quality but also facilitates continuous learning and development across the team.

See [Supported languages and technologies](../overview/supported-languages-and-technologies/) for particular areas of feedback that PureType may provide for a given language or technology.

## GitHub

#### Installation during onboarding

You will be prompted to install the [PureType GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/puretype) as one of the onboarding steps. Once installed, you will be prompted to configure the desired behaviour for reviews.
