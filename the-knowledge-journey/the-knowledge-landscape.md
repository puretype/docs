# The knowledge landscape

{% hint style="warning" %}
Knowledge landscape functionality is only available to [PureType Professional](https://puretype.ai/#pricing) users
{% endhint %}

The **knowledge landscape** is a collection of deductions and visualisations of a team's knowledge, as assessed by PureType. Below is a discussion of the theory supporting this functionality.

This collective information is designed to serve the best interests of all members of an engineering team, moving away from a linear "pass/fail" model of knowledge acquisition.

## Areas

Labelled clusters (**areas**) within [the knowledge graph](approach-to-learning.md#knowledge-graphs-1) represent groups of related concepts within a given language or technology that a team frequently utilizes. PureType deduces these clusters by analyzing the actual usage and interactions within a specific language or technology context.

By assessing recency and the level of understanding within a given area, the system can deliver tailored recommendations for improvement or highlight areas requiring oversight to engineering management. The _**areas of concern**_ functionality depends on this higher-level structure imposed upon a knowledge graph.

This insight empowers leaders to make data-driven decisions, focusing on enhancing team competencies at a much greater pace than before.

## Heatmaps

This approach allows team members to quickly identify areas of strength and weakness by visually interpreting color variations. The heatmap helps in recognizing patterns, spot trends, and derive insights about the distribution and concentration of knowledge within the team, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and strategic planning for skill development and resource allocation.

See [**Team Progress**](../the-learning-platform/team-progress.md) for a description of the dashboard and oversight functionality within the web interface itself.
