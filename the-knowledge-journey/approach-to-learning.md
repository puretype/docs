# Approach to learning

PureType's knowledge journey uses a number of existing educational theories to shape its educational approach.

This page outlines the theories guiding PureType's structured learning path, with commentary.

## Bloom's Taxonomy

[**Bloom's Taxonomy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's\_taxonomy) is a framework for categorising educational goals. The cognitive (knowledge-based) domain is divided into six levels of objectives:

For now, PureType focuses on the lower-order levels — **remember**, **understand** and **apply** — for the following reasons:

* **focus on single area** - the process of remembering, understanding and application can isolated to a single area and a set of concepts easily enough. In contrast, analysis, evaluation often require drawing knowledge from other areas for the process of comparison.
* **more objective, less subjective** - the nature of analysis, evaluation and creation require a subjective judgement of which factors are important to consider. Lacking that context, these processes are generally more suitable for discussion within a team.

### Knowledge Graphs

A well-constructed **knowledge graph** serves as a powerful tool in structuring learning materials and setting concepts within context. By mapping relationships between different concepts and areas of knowledge, these graphs facilitate a clear and organized method of learning. Learners can visually connect new information to what they already know, enhancing understanding and retention.

Moreover, knowledge graphs enable tracking and measuring progress against predefined learning outcomes. By breaking down learning objectives into interconnected nodes, educators and learners can establish clear milestones and assess progress efficiently.

This structured approach, in a tool like PureType, not only provides clarity but also helps in identifying areas needing further attention, thus supporting a focused and effective learning journey.

## Knowledge graphs

**Knowledge graphs** act as a foundational representation that provide context and structure to concepts within the learning process. By mapping the relationships and dependencies among various topics, these graphs create a network where learners can anchor new information to existing knowledge.

This visual and interconnected approach aids in deepening comprehension and improving memory retention. Additionally, knowledge graphs can enable precise tracking of learning progress. By associating learning outcomes with specific nodes and pathways within the graph, a learning platform like PureType can effectively measure understanding and advancement, ensuring that learning objectives are systematically achieved.

## Microlearning

**Microlearning** is learning delivered in bite-sized chunks. This modular approach offers a great way to deliver a focused answer to a single problem or question. With the context of a developer's current work, these modules are an ideal solution for just-in-time learning to work-related problems.

Establishing a habit of continuous learning, while utilizing microlearning principles, allows a developer to focus on specific areas without becoming overwhelmed by new material.

### Forgetting Curve

The [**Forgetting Curve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting\_curve) illustrates the decline of memory retention over time, highlighting how quickly information is lost if not reinforced. Without revision, people tend to forget around 50% of new information within one hour, 70% within 24 hours, and up to 90% within a week. These statistics underscore the importance of strategic learning interventions to combat the natural decay of knowledge retention.

Microlearning plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by the Forgetting Curve. By delivering content in small, manageable segments, learners are less likely to become overwhelmed, facilitating better retention. Additionally, incorporating regular follow-ups and reviews into the learning process can significantly improve memory retention by reinforcing knowledge at intervals, helping to reset the forgetting timeline and boost long-term retention.
