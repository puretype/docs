# Activities and exercises

Following the low-level parts of [Bloom's Taxonomy](approach-to-learning.md#blooms-taxonomy) (Remember, Understand and Apply), and an efficient approach to learning, the following activities and exercises are incorporated into PureType's exercise generation, suitable for various levels of understanding, while minimizing the need for lengthy text input.

The mix of exercises for a given area is a proprietary blend of different types and levels of exercises, based on previous interactions with PureType and what it has learnt about the developer's learning style, experience and capabilities.

## Remember

At this level, the focus is on recalling facts, terms, basic concepts, and answers:

* **Multiple choice questions** - present code snippets or concepts and ask developers to choose the correct description or outcome
* **Flashcards** - digital flashcards, including spaced repetition, with concepts, terms, or short code snippets on one side, and definitions or explanations on the other
* **Matching exercises** - drag-and-drop interfaces to match concepts with their defintions or use cases

## Understand

This level involves demonstrating understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, interpreting and stating main ideas:

* **Code snippet analysis** - present short code snippets and ask developers to identify the purpose or output
* **Concept mapping -** arrange pre-defined concepts and relationships with a given area to visually to establish relationships between them
* **Bug identification** - show code with intentional errors and ask developers to spot and classify the bugs

## Apply

At this level, learners solve problems by applying acquired knowledge and techniques in various ways:

* **Code completion** - present partially completed code and ask developers to fill in the blanks using dropdown menus or drag-and-drop elements
* **Psuedocode to code conversion** - provide pseudocode and ask developers to select the correct implementation from multiple options
* **Mini coding challenges** - present small, focused coding tasks that can be solved with minimal typing, using an in-browser editor
