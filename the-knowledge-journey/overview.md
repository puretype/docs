# Overview

PureType is designed to educate developers daily. It is driven by a belief that developers learn best in context and grow with follow-up.

This section of the documentation explains the theory and basis for PureType's "high context, high structure" approach to education:

* [**Approach to learning**](approach-to-learning.md) covers the foundational educational theories incorporated into the product's learning strategy
* [**Activities and exercises**](activities-and-exercises.md) details the principles behind the exercises provided by PureType's learning platform
* [**The knowledge landscape**](the-knowledge-landscape.md) explains the novel approach to capability assessment across the team
