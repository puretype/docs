# Guiding principles

## Feedback

During the feedback stage — regardless of time or location — PureType aims to be guided by the following principles:

* **Empower Developers**: Enhance the skills and capabilities of developers.
* **Identify High-Level Issues**: Detect problems that occur between modules and functions, rather than at the single line level
* **Embrace Subjectivity**: Focus on subjective insights; leave objective rules to traditional linters.
* **Promote Idiomatic Code**: Guide developers to write idiomatic code from the start to avoid bad habits setting in
* **Teach Something In Each Interaction**: Don’t just rearrange code. Refactor (correctly) and attach a lesson with each change
* **Take a Load Off**: suggest patterns that are hard to notice, but make the code much simpler
