# Data handling

Fully understanding your privacy and security needs, PureType provides this **data handling** overview with the goal of providing you with transparency as to how and what data is accessed, transferred and stored by PureType.

## Does it store my source code?

PureType **does not store source code**, either transiently or permanently, including any third-party providers that may handle source code on behalf of PureType.

The value of PureType's analysis is derived from analyzing the source code, and using the pattern of the issues detected to recommend and generate appropriate learning material to address the cause of these issues.

## Data types

The exact data that PureType handles depends on which components you have installed and the permissions you have granted them.

Below is a representative list of the types of data that PureType stores per platform user:

* **E-mail address** for access to the PureType web interface and to personalise recommendations based on activity
* **Issues detected** - the internal names of all issues detected, along with a hashed file+line representation to avoid unnecessary duplication
* **Learning metadata** - the area recommendations made, and summary statistics about how many sessions have been started, abandoned and finished
