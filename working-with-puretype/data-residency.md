# Data residency

Currently [PureType data](../how-puretype-handles-your-data.md#data-types) is stored within the European Union, with certain subprocessors storing their data in the United States under the Standard Contractual Clauses.

For further detail, and to discuss requirements for data residency beyond the above, e-mail [support@puretype.ai](mailto:support@puretype.ai).
