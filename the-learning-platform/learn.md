# Learn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-11-13 at 17.52.54 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>An example of three modules listed in the Learn interface</p></figcaption></figure>

[The Learn interface](https://app.puretype.ai/learn) is the main medium for knowledge acquisition, practice and application in suggested areas, across the relevant languages and technologies.

It guides developers through a web of information by simplifying the learning process. It organizes complex topics into easily digestible **modules**, allowing developers to focus on specific areas during microlearning sessions.

By breaking down information into manageable parts, PureType enhances concentration and retention, making learning more efficient and effective (see [Microlearning](../the-knowledge-journey/approach-to-learning.md#microlearning))

## Recommended modules

The top three recommended **modules** are listed, along with:

* a short description of the module contents
* a visual indication of the language or technology associated with the module
* a guide to the types of exercises involved in the module
* an estimated time to completion for the module

## Studying an area

Once a candidate area has been selected, a series of exercises is presented in an interface designed for focus. If suitable, a resource to read is provided before the exercises are listed.

For details on the types of activities and exercises, see [Activities and Exercises](../the-knowledge-journey/activities-and-exercises.md).

Interrupted studying sessions can be resumed via the web interface.
