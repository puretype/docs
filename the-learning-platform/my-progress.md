## Recent issues

This component provides a comprehensive list of issues identified by the automatic reviewer, affording developers detailed oversight of any discrepancies or errors in the data that underlies their knowledge journey.

## Summary statistics

_To be documented_

## Areas for improvement

{% hint style="warning" %}
This component is only available to [PureType Professional](https://puretype.ai/#pricing) users
{% endhint %}

This component offers an analysis of a developer's knowledge journey that is deeper than [the recommended areas](learn.md#recommended-modules) suggested in [the Learn interface](learn.md), along with particular resources and actions to take that may lie outside of the microlearning interface.

## What's happening?

The "What's happening?" component aggregates updates and milestones that the team has achieved, offering a clear and concise summary of ongoing developments. This not only fosters collaboration but also facilitates the continuous improvement of team strategies and goals.
