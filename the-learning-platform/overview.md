* [**Learn**](learn.md) - the main interface for knowledge acquisition, practice and application in suggested areas
* [**My Progress**](my-progress.md) - summary statistics, activity and suggested areas for improvement based on your activity
* [**Team Progress**](team-progress.md) - team-wide summary statistics, activity and, for [PureType Professional](https://puretype.ai/#pricing) users, the [Knowledge heatmap](team-progress.md#knowledge-heatmap) and [Areas of concern](team-progress.md#areas-of-concern) components for a deeper understanding of a team's capabilities
